Rate each from 1 (Not Me) to 5 (Exactly Me), and share any personal reflections if you wish.\n\nHere is the first question:\n\nWhen faced with a new situation or decision, how much do you tend to feel a primary impulse to withdraw inward, conserve your energy, and ensure your own resources or safety are protected first?\n\n1 = Not me at all, 5 = Exactly me\n\nYou can also share a personal example if you'd like."
